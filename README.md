<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a jQuery plugin that allows you to easily vertically centre elements on the page.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You must use jQuery, since it is a jQuery plugin.  You must add the script to the element after it has already loaded in the dom - this is usually done using the jQuery load function on the document.</p>

Example:<br />
```HTML
<script type="text/javascript">

$(document).ready(function(){
	$('#yourElement').keepVerticallyCentred();
});

</script>
```
